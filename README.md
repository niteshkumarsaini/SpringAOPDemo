# Spring AOP Demo Project

![Spring AOP Logo]([https://spring.io/images/favicon.png](https://banner2.cleanpng.com/20180328/ace/avb3vlspi.webp))  
*A comprehensive demo project for understanding and implementing Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) with Spring.*

---

## 🚀 About the Project

This project demonstrates the **complete implementation of Spring AOP** concepts in a practical and easy-to-understand manner. It highlights how Aspect-Oriented Programming helps decouple cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transaction management from the core business logic in a Spring application.

## 📚 Key Features

- **Before Advice**  
  Execute custom logic before the target method is invoked.

- **After Advice**  
  Run logic after the target method execution (success or failure).

- **Around Advice**  
  Wrap logic around the execution of the target method, controlling its behavior.

- **Pointcut Expressions**  
  Define precise matching logic for methods and parameter binding.

- **Aspect Configurations**  
  Configure and manage aspects using Spring annotations like `@Aspect`, `@Pointcut`, `@Before`, `@After`, and `@Around`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**  
  Core programming language for implementation.

- **Spring Framework**  
  Provides AOP support and dependency injection.

- **Maven**
 
 Dependency management and project structure.
📖 How to Use
Run the application and use REST API endpoints to test different services.
Observe how AOP advice executes for different scenarios like before, after, and around.
Check console logs for advice outputs and understand the flow of execution.
